# Process General Rule

## Task Tracking
- Create todo lists and status tracking markdown files in the 6-docs/status folder
- Use these files to maintain state and memory during complex tasks
- After task completion, ask the user if they want to delete the created files

## Development Workflows
- Use appropriate CLI commands for development, building, testing, database management, package management, publishing, and containerization
- Execute commands from the project root directory
- Ensure proper configuration (e.g., connection strings, SDK versions) before running database or deployment commands

## Code Review Checklists

### Architecture Compliance
- Files placed in correct numbered folder structure
- Dependencies flow downward (Domain → Application → Infrastructure)
- Repository pattern implemented for data access
- CQRS pattern followed for commands/queries
- Clean Architecture principles maintained

### Code Quality
- StyleCop rules pass without warnings
- No build errors or warnings
- Async/await used for all I/O operations
- Proper error handling with meaningful exceptions
- XML documentation on public APIs

### Security
- No secrets committed to source control
- Input validation implemented
- SQL injection prevention (parameterized queries)
- Authentication/authorization properly configured
- CORS and other security headers set

### Testing
- Unit tests cover new functionality
- Integration tests for data access
- Test coverage meets minimum requirements
- Mock external dependencies appropriately
- Test data properly managed

### Documentation
- Code changes documented in commit messages
- API changes reflected in OpenAPI specs
- README updated for new features
- Migration notes included for breaking changes

## Task Management Standards

### When to Create Todo Lists
- Complex tasks involving multiple steps or files
- Tasks requiring coordination across architectural layers
- Multi-day development efforts
- Tasks with unclear requirements needing iterative refinement
- When working with unfamiliar codebase sections

### Todo List Format
- Use markdown checklist format with [ ] for pending, [x] for completed, [-] for in progress
- List tasks in logical execution order
- Include specific, actionable descriptions
- Break down large tasks into smaller, verifiable steps
- Update status immediately after completing each item

### Integration with Memory Bank
- Update memory bank context.md after significant task completion
- Document new patterns or procedures discovered during tasks
- Add repetitive tasks to tasks.md for future reference
- Maintain project knowledge continuity across sessions

## When to Apply
Apply when managing tasks, creating status files, or executing development workflows in .NET projects.
